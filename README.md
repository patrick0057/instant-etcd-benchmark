# instant-etcd-benchmark
This script will download and install go and etcd benchmark.  The script is a little rough around the edges but it gets the job done. 

Usage:
```bash
curl -LO https://github.com/patrick0057/instant-etcd-benchmark/raw/master/instant-etcd-benchmark.sh
bash ./instant-etcd-benchmark.sh
```

Once benchmark has been installed you will be presented with some environment variables you need to set as well as some example commands for testing etcd's performance.
